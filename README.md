# Leetcode-solutions
This repository contains my LeetCode problem solutions, written mainly in C++ (and sometimes C). Itâ€™s a collection of solved coding challenges covering topics like arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, recursion, dynamic programming, and algorithms.

The purpose of this repository is to practice problem-solving skills, improve coding efficiency, and prepare for technical interviews while tracking my progress on LeetCode.

ðŸ”¹ Platform: LeetCode
ðŸ”¹ Languages Used: C, C++
ðŸ”¹ Focus Areas: Data Structures, Algorithms, Problem-Solving
ðŸ”¹ Goal: Consistent practice & interview preparation
